My C++ solutions to Advent of Code 2020

Advent of Code is a yearly collection of small rogramming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language of your chosen. Some people complete the puzzles for interview prep, while others race to get the solution as quick as possible in order to make it on the leaderboards. I was late to the party as my MSc. defense date was in the middle of the competition, so speed wasn't my goal.  I decided to complete all the puzzles at my own pace in C++ to increase my knowledge with the language. This was also my first brush with common programming techniques such as dynamic programming, associative arrays, and graph networks. I really enjoyed the dive into purely programming issues, as the usual problems I tackle are a mix of mechanical, hardware, and software.
